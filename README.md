Rajita is a simple windows desktop app to prepare and print medical descriptions. The application is designed according to the requirements of the doctors in Iraq.

The project is developed using Microsoft C sharp. The application does not require a database to store the data, instead files are used, which make the application very easy to install.

The installation package is already prepared and published in https://rajita.firebaseapp.com
